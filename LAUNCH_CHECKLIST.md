## Contingency Plans

### If Lovable doesn't work by Dec 10:
- Pivot to Railway (you already know it works)
- Adjust course title: "Build Your Bot with Railway"
- Still achievable for Jan 2

### If under 10 students by Dec 27:
- Option A: Run anyway (testimonials > revenue for first cohort)
- Option B: Push to Jan 9, extend marketing
- Option C: Offer free spots to fill seats (get testimonials)

### If tech fails during course:
- Have backup slides as PDF
- Pre-record a "worst case" walkthrough video
- Have Lovable project pre-built as fallback demo

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Stretch |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Students enrolled | 20 | 30 |
| Course completion | 80% | 95% |
| Testimonials collected | 5 | 10 |
| Course 2 interest | 5 | 10 |
| LLL Solutions inquiries | 2 | 5 |

---

## Time Investment Summary

| Week | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 (Lovable) | 10-15 hrs |
| Week 2 (Materials) | 8-12 hrs |
| Week 3 (Marketing) | 4-6 hrs |
| Week 4 (Prep) | 3-5 hrs |
| **Total** | **25-38 hrs** |

At $5 × 20 students = $100, first cohort ROI is low.
But: testimonials + Course 2 pipeline + future $47 cohorts = worth it.
